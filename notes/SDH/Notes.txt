    Hardwired font??  new Font(Font.SANS_SERIF, Font.PLAIN, 10)

    GraphicsUtil.drawText()                 -- line 230
    ComponentDrawContext.drawRectangle()    -- line 137


Horizontal / Vertical Split Panes

    Implemented to remove the visible controls of the split divider.

    VerticalSplitPane accessing members of Hoz, via package access
     rather than proper object hierarchy.

    ** Refactoring opportunity here

SVGIcon

    Hard-coded to 16x16.

    Are they used anywhere else in bigger form? If not, then why use
    SVG external file format at all? Would be a smaller footprint to
    simply use 16x16 pngs.
