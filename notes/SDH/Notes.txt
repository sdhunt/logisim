    Hardwired font??  new Font(Font.SANS_SERIF, Font.PLAIN, 10)

    GraphicsUtil.drawText()                 -- line 230
    ComponentDrawContext.drawRectangle()    -- line 137


Horizontal / Vertical Split Panes

    Implemented to remove the visible controls of the split divider.

    VerticalSplitPane accessing members of Hoz, via package access
     rather than proper object hierarchy.

    ** Refactoring opportunity here

SVGIcon

    Hard-coded to 16x16.

    Are they used anywhere else in bigger form? If not, then why use
    SVG external file format at all? Would be a smaller footprint to
    simply use 16x16 pngs.

Menuing System

    The WindowMenu is a special case, since we will be adding items to
    it dynamically, as projects are opened and closed. The classes in
    the util package (WindowMenu*) keep track of which window is active,
    and thus to which menu actions apply.

Attribute Sets
    Clone

        Clone semantics are not well defined; it is better to avoid clone() and
        use copy constructors. However... the following implement Cloneable:

        * AbstractAttributeSet

    Consider dropping SingletonSet from AttributeSets.
